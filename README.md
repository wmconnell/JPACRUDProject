## Lessons Learned

I learned how to connect the front and back ends of the stack. The process required a significant amount of troubleshooting, which helped solidify my understanding of mapping and CRUD. I really enjoyed this project, as it felt like I was really starting to be able to create some of things I can see in my imagination. I am excited to continue learning and growing with these skills.
